[pilin (pilind-, as in pl. pilindi) noun "arrow" (P√çLIM)](https://www.elfdict.com/w/pilin?include_old=1)

Pilin is a tiny library for [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) providing some functional programming constructions like:
- Functor,
- Applicative,
- Monad.

Some incarnations are available like Identity, Option and Either.

Since Kotlin has colored function, the design has been done with only suspended functions.
In this approach `suspend` does not mean functions interacting with the subsystem 
i.e. no Relationship with IO.

The main advantage of this approach is the capability to deliver a comprehension like
approach in order to simplify the code.

The construction is based on a highly modular system inspired by the [Preface](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/index.html)
library and of course [Arrow.kt](https://arrow-kt.io) for the comprehension implementation.

## A taste of Pilin

### Functor internal design

```kotlin
object Functor {

    interface Core<F> {
        suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<F, A>, App<F, B>>
    }

    class Operation<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend fun <A, B> replace(a: A): Fun<App<F, B>, App<F, A>> =
            map { a }

        suspend fun <A> void(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, Unit> =
            replace<Unit, A>(Unit)(ma)
    }

    open class Infix<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend infix fun <A, B> (Fun<A, B>).map(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, B> = c.map(this)(ma)
    }

    interface API<F> : Core<F> {
        val operation: Operation<F> get() = Operation(this)
        val infix: Infix<F> get() = Infix(this)
    }
}
```

### Option Functor

```kotlin
object Option {

    sealed class T<A> : App<TK, A> {
        data class None<A>(private val u: Unit = Unit) : T<A>()
        data class Some<A>(val value: A) : T<A>()
    }

    // This code can be automatically generated
    class TK private constructor() {
        companion object {
            private val <A> App<TK, A>.fix: T<A>
                get() = this as T<A>

            fun <A> none(): App<TK, A> = T.None()
            fun <A> some(a: A): App<TK, A> = T.Some(a)

            suspend fun <A, B> App<TK, A>.fold(n: Supplier<B>, s: Fun<A, B>): B =
                when (val self = this.fix) {
                    is T.None -> n()
                    is T.Some -> s(self.value)
                }
        }
    }

    private class FunctorImpl : Functor.API<TK> {
        override suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<TK, A>, App<TK, B>> =
            { ma -> ma.fold(::none) { a -> some(f(a)) } }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

### Comprehension in action

```kotlin
Comprehension(Option.monad) {
    val (a) = returns(40)
    val (b) = returns(2)
    a + b
}
```

Of course this code can be generalized sine monad is injected:

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> doSomething(m: Monad.API<T>): App<T, Int> =
    Comprehension(m) {
        val (a) = returns(40)
        val (b) = returns(2)
        a + b
    }
```
