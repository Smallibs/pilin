[pilin (pilind-, as in pl. pilindi) noun "arrow" (PÍLIM)](https://www.elfdict.com/w/pilin?include_old=1)

Pilin is a library for [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) providing some functional
programming constructions like:

- Semigroup,
- Monoid,
- PreCategory,
- Category,
- ProFunctor,
- Functor,
- Applicative,
- Selective,
- Monad

Some incarnations are available like:

- Identity,
- Option,
- Either,
- List,
- Continuation,
- Reader,
- Writer,
- State,
- Freer.

Since Kotlin has colored functions, the design has been done with only suspended functions. In this approach `suspend`
does not mean functions interacting with the subsystem i.e. no relationship with IO for instance.

The construction is based on a highly modular system inspired by
the [Preface](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/index.html)
library and [Thermometer Continuations](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01929178/document) for the comprehension
implementation.

## A taste of Pilin

In this section we show how the `Functor` abstraction is design.

### Functor design

First we use `object` in order to have a simple namespacing. Then, a first interface named `Core` is proposed with the
minimal set of functions required. In addition, two implementations are proposed for `Operation` and `Infix` expressed
thanks to the `Core`. The first one contains additional functions when the second proposes an infix version of `Core`
functions using OOP capabilities.

```kotlin
object Functor {

    interface Core<F> {
        suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<F, A>, App<F, B>>
    }

    class Operation<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend fun <A, B> replace(a: A): Fun<App<F, B>, App<F, A>> =
            map { a }

        suspend fun <A> void(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, Unit> =
            replace<Unit, A>(Unit)(ma)
    }

    open class Infix<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend infix fun <A, B> Fun<A, B>.map(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, B> =
            c.map(this)(ma)
        suspend infix fun <A, B> App<F, A>.map(f: Fun<A, B>): App<F, B> =
            c.map(f)(this)
    }

    interface API<F> : Core<F> {
        val operation: Operation<F> get() = Operation(this)
        val infix: Infix<F> get() = Infix(this)
    }
}
```

### Option

In this section we show how `Option` can be designed.

#### Data type definition

First at all, the data type should be specified. Of course, an optional value is `None` of `Some` value. In addition, an
internal class `OptionK` - for type kind - using a type defunctionalised as illustrated
in [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf)
.

In this `OptionK` class, a `fix` value is proposed when a downcast is required. This operation is of course unsafe, but
to reduce this aspect the scope of the constructor is limited to `Option`. Finally, the catamorphism `fold` function is
suggested.

Smart constructors and abstraction implementation references can be proposed.

```kotlin
sealed class Option<A> : App<OptionK, A> {
    object None : Option<Nothing>()
    data class Some<A>(val value: A) : Option<A>()

    class OptionK private constructor() {
        companion object {
            val <A> App<OptionK, A>.fix: Option<A>
                get() = this as Option<A>

            suspend fun <A, B> App<OptionK, A>.fold(n: Supplier<B>, s: Fun<A, B>): B =
                when (val self = this.fix) {
                    is None -> n()
                    is Some -> s(self.value)
                }
        }
    }

    companion object {
        fun <A> none(): Option<A> = None
        fun <A> some(a: A): Option<A> = Some(a)

        val functor = Functor.functor
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Functor implementation for Option

The `Functor` abstraction implementation can then be proposed. This is done once again using object namespacing.

```kotlin
object Functor {
    private class FunctorImpl : Functor.API<OptionK> {
        override suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<OptionK, A>, App<OptionK, B>> =
            { ma -> ma.fold(::none, f then ::some) }
    }

    val functor: Functor.API<OptionK> = FunctorImpl()
}
```

## Comprehension in action

Using functional idioms like `Monad` can be painful. For instance, if we want to add two optional integers we must write
the following code:

```kotlin
with(Option.monad.infix) {
    returns(40) * returns(2) map { (a, b) ->
        a + b
    }
}
```

In order to have a more readable version a comprehension based formulation is provided. Then the previous expression can
be proposed using such comprehension facility:

```kotlin
Option.monad `do` {
    returns(40).bind() + returns(2).bind()
}
```

Finally, a generalized version can be proposed for any Monad and not only for `Option`.

```kotlin
suspend fun <F> doSomething(m: Monad.API<F>): App<F, Int> =
    m `do` {
        returns(40).bind() + returns(2).bind()
    }
```

Each operation should be executed thanks to the `bind()` function. Otherwise, the effect is never executed.

Of course, the applicative can be used in this case:

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> doSomething(a: Applicative.API<T>): App<T, Int> =
    with(a.infix) {
        val plus = curry { a: Int, b: Int -> a + b }
        plus map pure(40) apply pure(2) // or pure(plus) apply pure(40) apply pure(2)
    }
```

## Onboard user defined effects

In addition, user defined effects can be proposed and seamlessly combined with predefined effects like continuation,
either, option etc.

### Console effect specification

We specify a user defined effect able to read and print strings. The resulting effect of each operation is defined using
a parametric `F`.

```kotlin
class Console<F>(
    val printString: (String) -> App<F, Unit>,
    val readString: App<F, String>,
) : Handler
```    

## Code using effect specification

Therefor we can write a naive program using such effect specification thanks to comprehension.

```kotlin
private fun <F> program(monad: Monad.API<F>): Effects<Console<F>, App<F, Unit>> =
    handle { console ->
        monad `do` {
            val value = console.readString.bind()
            console.printString("Hello $value").bind()
        }
    }
```

## Defining my own console

Of course, an implementation can be provided. In this example the effect used is `Continuation`.

```kotlin
fun console(traces: MutableList<String>) =
    Console(
        printString = { text ->
            object : Continuation<Unit> {
                override suspend fun <O> invoke(k: Fun<Unit, O>): O {
                    traces.add("printString($text)")
                    return k(Unit)
                }
            }
        },
        readString = object : Continuation<String> {
            override suspend fun <O> invoke(k: Fun<String, O>): O {
                traces.add("readStream(World)")
                return k("World")
            }
        }
    )
```

**Note**: we cannot use functional interface for continuation construction i.e. problem with existential type.

## Executing the program with a dedicated console

Then the previous program can be executed with the user defined effect implemented by `console`. Since all constructions
return suspended functions this execution should be performed thanks to the standard `runBlocking` function.

```kotlin
val traces = mutableListOf<String>()
val handled = program(Continuation.monad) with console(traces)

runBlocking { handled().invoke { } }
```

Finally, after the execution `traces` has the following value: `listOf("readString(World)", "printString(Hello World)")`
