[pilin (pilind-, as in pl. pilindi) noun "arrow" (P√çLIM)](https://www.elfdict.com/w/pilin?include_old=1)

Pilin is a library for [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) providing some functional programming constructions like:
- Functor,
- Applicative,
- Monad.

Some incarnations are available like Identity, Option and Either.

Since Kotlin has colored functions, the design has been done with only suspended functions.
In this approach `suspend` does not mean functions interacting with the subsystem 
i.e. no Relationship with IO.

The main advantage of this approach is the capability to deliver a comprehension like
approach in order to simplify the code.

The construction is based on a highly modular system inspired by the [Preface](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/index.html)
library and of course [Arrow.kt](https://arrow-kt.io) for the comprehension implementation.

## A taste of Pilin

In this section we show how the `Functor` abstraction is designed. 

### Functor design

First we use `object` in order to have a string namespacing. Then a first interface named `Core` is proposed with the minimal set 
of function required. In addition two implementations are  proposed for `Operation` and `Infix` expressed thanks to the `Core`. 
The first one contains contains additional functions when the second proposes an infix version of `Core` functions using OOP 
capabilities.

```kotlin
object Functor {

    interface Core<F> {
        suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<F, A>, App<F, B>>
    }

    class Operation<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend fun <A, B> replace(a: A): Fun<App<F, B>, App<F, A>> =
            map { a }

        suspend fun <A> void(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, Unit> =
            replace<Unit, A>(Unit)(ma)
    }

    open class Infix<F>(private val c: Core<F>) : Core<F> by c {
        suspend infix fun <A, B> (Fun<A, B>).map(ma: App<F, A>): App<F, B> = 
            c.map(this)(ma)
    }

    interface API<F> : Core<F> {
        val operation: Operation<F> get() = Operation(this)
        val infix: Infix<F> get() = Infix(this)
    }
}
```

### Option

In this section we show how `Option` can be designed.

#### Data type definition

First at all, the data type should be specified. Of course, an optional value is `None` of `Some` value. In addition an internal class `TK` - for type kind - 
using a type defunctionalised as illustrated in [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf).

In this `TK` class, a `fix` value is proposed when a downcast is required. This operation is of course dangerous, but to reduce this aspect the scope of the constructor is limited to `Option`. In addtion, the catamorphism `fold` function is proposed.

Finally, smart constructors and abstraction implementation references can be proposed.

```kotlin
sealed class Option<A> : App<Option.TK, A> {
    data class None<A>(private val u: Unit = Unit) : Option<A>()
    data class Some<A>(val value: A) : Option<A>()

    class TK private constructor() {
        companion object {
            val <A> App<TK, A>.fix: Option<A>
                get() = this as Option<A>

            suspend fun <A, B> App<TK, A>.fold(n: Supplier<B>, s: Fun<A, B>): B =
                when (val self = this.fix) {
                    is None -> n()
                    is Some -> s(self.value)
                }
        }
    }

    companion object {
        fun <A> none(): App<TK, A> = None()
        fun <A> some(a: A): App<TK, A> = Some(a)

        val functor = Functor.functor
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Functor implementation for Option

The `Functor` abstraction implementation can then be proposed. This is done once again using object namespacing.

```kotlin
object Functor {
    private class FunctorImpl : Functor.API<Option.TK> {
        override suspend fun <A, B> map(f: Fun<A, B>): Fun<App<Option.TK, A>, App<Option.TK, B>> =
            { ma -> ma.fold(::none) { a -> some(f(a)) } }
    }

    val functor: Functor.API<Option.TK> = FunctorImpl()
}
```

## Comprehension in action

Using functional idioms like `Monad` can be painfull. For instance if we want to add to optional integers
we must write the following code:

```kotlin
with(Option.monad.infix) {
    returns(40) bind { a ->
        returns(2) bind { b -> 
            returns(a + b)
        }
    } 
}
```

In order to have a more readable version a comprehension based formulation is provided. 
Then the previoux expression can be proposed using such comprehension facility:

```kotlin
Comprehension(Option.monad) {
    val (a) = returns(40)       // or val a = returns(40).bind()
    val (b) = returns(2)        // or val b = returns(2).bind()
    a + b
}
```

An infix version is also proposed with the Monad extension method `do`: 

```kotlin
Option.monad `do` {
    val (a) = returns(40)
    val (b) = returns(2)
    a + b
}
```

Finally, an generalized version can be proposed for any Monad and not only for `Option`.

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> doSomething(m: Monad.API<T>): App<T, Int> =
    m `do` {
        val (a) = returns(40)
        val (b) = returns(2)
        a + b
    }
```

Note: the `Comprehension` uses Kotlin coroutine suspension. 

Of course the applicative can be used in this case:

```kotlin
val plus: Fun<Int, Fun<Int, Int>> = { a -> { b -> a + b } }

with(Option.applicative.infix) {
    plus map pure(40) apply pure(2)
}
```
